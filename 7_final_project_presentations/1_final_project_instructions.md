### Learning Outcomes:

- Formulate a meaningful and answerable Data Science research question.
- Munge real data.
- Create and tune a machine learning model.
- Communicate your process and findings to a technical audience.
- Write working and well-organized code.

You should follow the Data Science Workflow:

1. Ask the right question.
2. Acquire the relevant data.
3. Process the data.
4. Model the data with machine learning.
5. Deliver: Create presentation and Jupyter Notebook.

These steps are iterative (do a little preprocessing, do a little modeling, redo the preprocessing, …).

This project will become a part of your public Data Science portfolio, thus all data must be public data.  

Make your own groups of 3 students (a single group with 4 students is okay) within each section.

----

1. Ask.

	This is your project so it is up to your team to develop the right question. 

2. Acquire.
	
	It is best if your team picks a single, unique dataset. The instructor will approve the data to make sure it is appropriate and within scope.

    The dataset should be primarily tabular. No image data is allowed. A small amount of text data is okay, but it should a minor set of features.

	Acquiring data should not take away from the other aspects of the project (i.e., no collecting or web scraping the data). 

3. Process.

	What specific munging issues do you have to address (e.g., encoding, missing data, or data to exclude)? What descriptive/summary statistics are useful for understanding your data? What figures provide insight into your data?

3. Model.

	You must fit at least 2 different types of algorithms and compare results. For example, your team could pick logistic regression and Random Forest™. Or your team could pick k-means clustering and spectral clustering.

    Each algorithm's hyperparameters should be tuned.

5. Deliver(ables).

    There are two deliverables:

    1. An in-class presentation either on 12-03-19 (section 1) or 12-06-19 (section 2). The presentation will be 6 minutes with 1 minute of questions and (hopefully) answers.
    2. Jupyter Notebooks in a public GitHub repository documenting your work are due on 12-11-19 by 6pm.

Hints
----

- Make it run, make it right, make it fast. (in that order)
- Go end-to-end as quickly possible. From raw data -> basic features -> simple model -> evaluation. Then explore options for each stage.
- How do I get a "A"? 
    - Do something groundbreaking (seriously). Either ground-breaking for the field or for the class.
    - Fit models and use methodologies from outside class materials.
    - Error bars!!!
